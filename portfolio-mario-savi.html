<!-- # Project: Portfolio Website

Your next assignment is to build a portfolio site for yourself using all that we've learned. Start by mocking things up with a pen and paper or a graphics program before you start coding - submit this as well. Keep track of your progress using Git. Make at least 6-10 commits as your project progresses. You don't need to make a commit for every single minor change, but instead for each set of changes that adds to your website, or "feature". Also a commit before almost any code is written, is your "initial commit."

It should have the following features:

- At least 3 separate pages. For example: Home, About, Contact
_3 Points_

- Uses CSS layout principles we've learned including adding a gutter to the left and right of the page
_3 Points_

- Includes photographs. You can find some good resources for images [here](http://nycda.com/blog/8-places-to-find-free-high-definition-images-for-your-website/?utm_source=assignments&utm_medium=curriculum&utm_campaign=portfolio).
_6 Points_

- Has links to external websites that open in a new window. Because this is your portfolio, we recommend that you put up links to the homework you've done in the past few weeks and that you come back to this site later on to add links to your future work.
- Incorporates a `<ul>` and `<nav>` powered navigation bar
_2 Points_

- Overall quality of site
_3 Points_

- Is well commented and pushed to github
_3 Points_ -->
