	<h1>About</h1>

	<h3>A little bit about my professional experience:</h3>

		<p>After 5.5 years at Booking.com - the last 1.5 embedded in an Agile team as Content Specialist - I decided to do some upgrades and learn Web Development, which I'm currently doing at the New York Code + Design Academy, through the B. Startup School Amsterdam.</p>
		<p>Between both experiences, I spent a month as a Web Editor at The Student Hotel, learnt more in practice about running campaigns on AdWords and Facebook, helped revamp and re-prioritise their web backlog, though I realised it wasn't the moment nor the challenge I needed, so I decided to take the current coding course.</p>
		<p>Experience and skills developed along these years: Coordinating with stakeholders around the globe, running and analysing user research, querying and analysing data, prioritising and managing backlogs, project management, content management, coordinating with agencies for different types of campaigns, among others.</p>
